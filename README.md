1.	Introduction

1.1	Purpose

The purpose of this app is to provide an interactive and engaging fantasy football experience for users, allowing them to play with friends and customize various aspects of the game. Users can create and manage fantasy football teams, draft players, and track live updates of player performance, including injury status and game statistics. The app also enables users to monitor the overall team scores, individual player scores, and the status of NFL teams, including their position on the field and possession of the ball.
An administrator can set up the league, invite participants, and define the league's rules, such as team size, draft rules, bye weeks, playoff schedules, and other fantasy football settings. The app will be accessible via Android, iOS, and a web platform, ensuring a wide reach for users to enjoy the game on their preferred devices.
